## My Coding Temple journey so far... 😅

Well, let's see. Today is 📆 April 18, 2024 and it is 🕠 12:53 am. It's been about a month and a half since I started the class and 😟 I feel like I am lagging and way behind on things.
I picked the flex class due to the fact that I have a full-time job 👨‍🔬 but on top of that, there's been a series of unforeseen 🙈 events that happened in the past few weeks.
Anyway, so far so good and I'm liking it. 👍 I'm actually thinking 🤔 of burning the boat ⛵ to the point of no return and just focus on my studies.
This shall force me to study hard 👨‍🎓 , fast and make sure I get to the finish line. 🏁
